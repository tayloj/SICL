\section{Introduction}

The \commonlisp{} standard contains many references to environments.
Most of these references concern \emph{lexical} environments at
\emph{compile time}, because they are needed in order to process forms
in non-null lexical environments.  The standard does not specify the
nature of these objects, though in CLtL2 \cite{Steele:1990:CLL:95411}
there is a suggested protocol that is sometimes supplied in existing
\commonlisp{} implementations. 

When it comes to \emph{global environments}, however, the standard is
even more silent.  In section 3.2.1 (entitled Compiler Terminology) of
the \commonlisp{} \hs{}, the distinction is made between the
\emph{startup environment}, the \emph{compilation environment}, the
\emph{evaluation environment}, and the \emph{runtime environment}.
Excluding the runtime environment, the standard allows for all the
others to be identical.
