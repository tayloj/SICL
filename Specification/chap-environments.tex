\chapter{Environments}
\label{chap-environments}

\commonlisp{} has a concept of \emph{environments}, and in fact several
different environments and several different \emph{kinds} of
environment are mentioned in the \hs{}.  However, \commonlisp{} does not
mandate any particular representation of these environments, nor does
it mention any particular \emph{operations} on environments other than
the implicit operations of defining functions, variables, macros,
types, etc. 

\section{The global environment}
\label{sec-the-global-environment}

In many \commonlisp{} systems the global environment is \emph{spread out} in
that it does not have an explicit definition as a data type.  Parts of
it might be contained in global locations such as the set of packages
or the set of classes.  Other parts of it may be stored in symbols
such as the value or the function definition of a symbol.  The
standard specifically allows for this kind of spread-out
representation.  

In \sysname{}, we prefer to have an explicit representation of the
global environment as a data object.  By doing it this way, we can
allow for any number of global environments present in the system at
any point in time.  Different global environments can have a different
set of packages, a different set of classes, a different set of types,
etc.  This representation can give us several interesting advantages: 

\begin{itemize}
\item We might ensure that there is always a \emph{sane} environment
  present in case some environment gets destroyed (by a user
  accidentally removing some essential system function, for instance).
\item We can allow for several different packages with the same name
  to exist in a system, as long as they are present in different
  environments, which would allow for simpler experimentation with
  different versions of packages. 
\item We could even imagine a multi-user system based on different
  environments, and we could then allow users to do things such as
  defining \texttt{:after} methods on \texttt{print-object} that are
  private to that user. 
\item etc.
\end{itemize}

A global environment in \sysname{} would then contain:

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of \emph{packages}, represented either as a list or as a
  hash table mapping names to packages.
\item A dictionary of \emph{classes}, represented either as an
  association list or as a hash table mapping names to classes.
\item A mapping from function names to entries representing functions,
  macros, compiler macros, and special operators.
\item A mapping from names to entries representing type definitions.
\item A mapping from names to entries representing \emph{dynamic variables}.
\item Values of \emph{constant variables}.
\item A set of \emph{proclamations} concerning types of variables and
  functions, but also \emph{autonomous} proclamations such as
  \texttt{optimize} and \texttt{declaration}.
\item etc.\fixme{State exactly what the global environment contains.}
\end{itemize}

There are many possible choices for representing the global
environment.  For instance, it might seem reasonable to have the
global environment contain a single entry for each \emph{name} in a
particular namespece, and to have that entry contain all the relevant
information about the name.  In \sysname{} we have chosen to do it
differently.  Each name can be associated with several different
entries, and each entry only handles one aspect of the name.  For
instance, for a function name, there might be one entry for it as a
special operator and another as a macro, or there might be one entry
for it as a function, another for its type, a third one indicating
that it can be inlined, etc. 

We divide the entries into \emph{base entries} and \emph{auxiliary
  entries}.  A base entry does not refer to any other entries.
Macros, functions, special operators, and autonomous proclamations are
represented by base entries.  An auxiliary entry refers to a base
entry.  Declarations such as \texttt{inline}, \texttt{type}, and
\texttt{dynamic-extent} are represented by auxiliary entries. 

There can be several auxiliary entries referring to one base entry and
they may combine in different ways.  For instance, the type
declaration entries referring to one base entry combine as
\texttt{and}, whereas with several \texttt{inline} entries only the
first one found (i.e., the most recent one established) counts. 

\subsection{Functions, macros, compiler macros, and special operators}

This mapping is manipulated by \texttt{symbol-function}, \texttt{(setf
  symbol-function)}, \texttt{fdefinition}, \texttt{(setf
  fdefinition)}, \texttt{fboundp}, \texttt{fmakunbound},
\texttt{compiler-macro-function}, \texttt{(setf compiler-macro-function)}
\texttt{defun}, \texttt{defgeneric}, \texttt{proclaim}, and
\texttt{declaim}.

\subsection{Dynamic variables}

This mapping is manipulated by \texttt{defvar}, \texttt{defparameter},
\texttt{set}, \texttt{symbol-value}, \texttt{(setf symbol-value)}
\texttt{proclaim}, \texttt{declaim}, \texttt{boundp}, and
\texttt{makunbound}.

The mapping is typically represented as a list of \emph{dynamic
  variable entries}.  Each dynamic variable entry contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{name} of the dynamic variable.  The name is a symbol. 
\item The \emph{value cell} of the dynamic variable.  The value cell
  is a \texttt{cons} cell where the \texttt{car} of the cell contains
  the \emph{value} of the variable, and the \texttt{cdr} of the cell
  contains \texttt{nil}. 
\item A Boolean slot \emph{created} indicating whether the variable
  has been created by a \texttt{defvar} or a \texttt{defparameter}
  form.  If the value of this slot is \texttt{false}, then the
  \texttt{car} of the value cell is always \emph{unbound}.  The value
  of this slot is set to \emph{false} if the entry was created by a
  type declaration by \texttt{proclaim} or \texttt{declaim}.  It is
  set to \texttt{true} by \texttt{defvar}, \texttt{defparameter}, or a
  \texttt{special} declaration by \texttt{proclaim} or
  \texttt{declaim}.  Once it has been set to \emph{true} it can never
  become \emph{false} again.
\item The \emph{type} of the dynamic variable.  
\end{itemize}

An \emph{unbound} dynamic variable can be represented in two ways.
Either it is not present at all in the mapping, or else it is present,
but the \texttt{car} of the value cell contains the special immediate
value indicating \emph{unbound}.  \seesec{data-representation-unbound}

The function \texttt{symbol-value} signals an error if the variable is
unbound.  Otherwise, it returns the contents of the \texttt{car} of
the \emph{value cell} of the entry.

The function \texttt{(setf symbol-value)} starts by checking whether
an entry exists, and if not creates one marked as \emph{created}, sets
its \emph{type} to \texttt{t} and its value from the argument to the
function.  Then with either the existing or the newly created entry,
it compares the value of the argument to the type of the entry.  If
the type check passes, the \texttt{car} of the value cell is
modified.  Otherwise an error is signaled.  The function \texttt{set}
works the same way. 

The macro \texttt{defvar} searches the mapping for the variable entry.
The following situations can occur:
\begin{itemize}
\item The item is present, and marked as \emph{created}.  Then nothing
  happens.  If the variable is unbound it remains unbound.
\item The item is present but not marked as \emph{created}.  This
  situation happens when the \emph{type} of the variable has been
  declared, but no previous \texttt{defvar} or \texttt{defparameter}
  for has been executed for the variable.  Then, if the
  \texttt{defvar} form has an \emph{initial value} form, that
  \emph{initial value} form is evaluated, and its value is checked
  against the type of the entry.  If the type check passes, then the
  value of the \emph{initial value} form is given as the value of the
  variable and the entry is marked as \emph{created}.  If the type
  check does not pass, then an error is signaled.  If the
  \texttt{defvar} form does not have an \emph{initial value} form, the
  entry is marked as \emph{created}.
\item The item is not present.  Then an entry is created.  It type is
  set to \texttt{t}.  If the \texttt{defvar} form contains
  an \emph{initial value} form, then the \emph{initial value} form is
  evaluated, and its value is stored in the \texttt{car} of the value
  cell.  Otherwise, the \texttt{car} of the value cell is set to
  \emph{unbound}. 
\end{itemize}

The macro \texttt{defparameter} searches the mapping for the variable
entry.  If no entry is found, one is created and its type is set to
\texttt{t}.  Then the \emph{initial value} form of the
\texttt{defparameter} form is evaluated, and its value is checked
against the type of the entry.  If the type check passes, then the
value of the \emph{initial value} form is given as the value of the
variable and the variable is marked as \emph{created}.  If the type
check does not pass, then an error is signaled.

When \texttt{proclaim} or \texttt{declaim} is used to declare a type
for a variable, the mapping is searched for an entry.  If no entry
exists, a new one is created with the slot named \emph{created} set to
\emph{false}, the value cell set to \emph{unbound} and the type set to
\texttt{t}.  Then with either the existing or the newly created entry,
the following can happen:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the value is \emph{unbound}, then the type is simply
  updated.  
\item If the value is not \emph{unbound}, then the new type is
  verified against the existing value of the variable.  If the test
  passes, the type of the entry is modified, otherwise an error is
  signaled. 
\end{itemize}

When a dynamic variable is used in compiled code, the \emph{value
  cell} is also referred to from the \emph{linkage vector} of the code
object resulting from the compilation.  This way, when the global
value is altered, compiled code will see the change.  Furthermore, the
value cell in the linkage vector can be accessed directly by its
\emph{offset} so there is no need to search the environment.  Compiled
code will access this value when no binding of the variable is found
in the \emph{dynamic environment}.  Notice that this also means that
the linkage vector of code objects can not be shared between different
global environments.

There is no mechanism for \emph{deleting} a dynamic variable, so once
an entry has been created, it can not be deleted, unless the entire
global environment is deleted. 

\section{The static runtime environment}
\label{sec-environments-static-runtime}

The \emph{static runtime environment} contains runtime objects that
the compiler can not prove to have \emph{dynamic extent}, so it must
assume that they have \emph{indefinite extent}.  

This situation occurs when some function captures the environment by
using a \texttt{lambda} expression which contains references to local
variables outside the expression itself.  Though such a capture in
itself does not necessarily imply that the variables thus referenced
have indefinite extent.  It all depends on what happens to the
function that is the result of the lambda expression.  

If that function is just \emph{called}, then there is no capture.  This
situation might occur as a result of a \texttt{let} being transformed
into an application of a \texttt{lambda} expression.  

If that function is passed as an argument to another function which is
known not to hold on to its argument for longer than the duration of
the function invocation, then there is no capture.  The typical
situation would be when a \texttt{lambda} expression is passed to a
standard \commonlisp{} function such as one of the \emph{sequence} functions
that is known to have this property.  

In other cases, it might be too risky for the compiler to assume
dynamic extent.  Even if a function is called which declares its
corresponding parameter to have dynamic extent, it might be too risky
to trust this, because the function might be redefined later.%
\footnote{An exception would be if the called function is in the same
  \emph{compilation unit} in which case it can not be redefined
  without the caller being redefined at the same time.}

When the compiler must assume that some variable has indefinite
extent, then code must be generated to store that variable in a
heap-allocated environment.  We represent this environment as a proper
\commonlisp{} list of simple vectors.  

This representation might seem wasteful, because a simple vector is
represented as a header object and a rack containing the
\emph{length} of the vector, though that information is implicit in
the value of the program counter, so it could be elided.  The
representation is wasteful in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Allocation is a bit slower because two chunks of memory must be
  allocated and linked, and length information must be stored. 
\item Looking up the value of a variable requires another
  indirection. 
\end{itemize}

However, we think this apparent waste is going to be insignificant.
Take for instance the example of a sequence function.  The capture
itself (and the allocation of the environment) is going to be
insignificant compared to the processing done by the sequence
function.  Furthermore, the access to the captured variable is going
to be insignificant compared to the overhead of calling the closure
from the sequence function because of all the checks that have to be
made such as argument count, etc.  

The main reason for choosing this representation is that it has
some advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item Currently, every general instance has a header object and a
  rack.  If we were to use a different representation for
  environments, then they would have to be allocated in a dedicated
  part of the heap, and that would make the memory-management system
  significantly more complicated.
\item By using existing standard object types, we simplify their
  manipulation, and we can use standard accessor functions on them.
\item Introspection becomes simpler, because no special code is
  required in order to inspect the static runtime environment.  If a
  special representation were chosen, specific code would be required
  for its introspection.  In particular we can then simplify the
  debugger. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Runtime information}

The compiler will generate runtime information available both to the
debugger and to the garbage collector.  For each value of the program
counter%
\footnote{The values of the program counter are \emph{relative} to the
  beginning of the code object}, all local locations in use (in
registers, stack frame, or static environment) have associated type
information.  Maintaining this type information does not require any
runtime overhead.  All that is required is a mapping from a program
counter value to a block of runtime information.

A location can have one of different types of values:

\begin{itemize}
\item Tagged Lisp value.  This is the most general type.  It covers
  every possible Lisp value.  The garbage collector must trace the
  object contained in this location according to its type, which the
  garbage collector itself has to test for. 
\item Raw machine value.  No location will be tagged with this type,
  but instead with any of the subtypes given below.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Raw immediate machine value
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Raw integer.
      \item Raw Unicode character.
      \item Raw floating-point value.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Raw machine pointer
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Raw machine pointer to a cons cell.  
    \item Raw machine pointer to the header object of a general
      instance.
    \item Raw machine pointer that may point inside the rack
      of some other object. In this case, the location has to
      be indicated as \emph{tied} to another location that contains
      either a Lisp pointer or a raw machine pointer to one of the
      previous types.  This possibility will be used when (say) a
      pointer to an object is stored in some location, and a temporary
      pointer to one of the elements of the object is needed.  The
      garbage collector will modify this pointer value by the same
      amount as that used to modify the rack. 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
