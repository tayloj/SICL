;;; Function append

;;; It used to be the case that the append function was defined
;;; in terms of (loop ... append ...), but it turns out that
;;; some implementations have buggy versions of (loop ... append ...) 
;;; so it is better to just define it in terms of a lower-level
;;; construct.  Doing it this way allows for implementations with 
;;; a buggy loop to still use this module without first replacing
;;; loop by ours.
