;;; Compute a set of conflicts for the register allocator.  Recall
;;; that two variables generate a conflict when one is live at the
;;; point where the other is written to.  Furthermore, all items that
;;; are written to by the same instruction conflict with each other.
;;;
;;; We do not want multiple copies of some conflict.  We have to be
;;; careful because the relation is symmetric, so that if (L1 . L2) is
;;; a conflict in the set, we do not want to add (L2 . L1) because it
;;; is the same conflict.
;;;
;;; Conflicts are computed only for lexical variables.  Other types of
;;; locations are ignored.
