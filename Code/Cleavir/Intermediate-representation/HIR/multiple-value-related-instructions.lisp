;;; Instruction MULTIPLE-TO-FIXED-INSTRUCTION.
;;;
;;; This instruction takes a single input of type VALUES-LOCATION and
;;; a list of outputs that are LEXICAL-LOCATIONs.  The purpose is to
;;; assign multiple values to one or more ordinary lexical locations.
;;; The assignment is done so that if fewer ordinary lexical locations
;;; are required than there are values contained in the
;;; VALUES-LOCATION, then the remaining values are ignored, and if
;;; more ordinary lexical locations are required than there are values
;;; contained in the VALUES-LOCATION, then the remaining ordinary
;;; lexical locations are assigned to NIL.

;;; This instruction takes a list of inputs that are LEXICAL-LOCATIONs

;;; a location containing multiple values.  The assignment is done so
;;; that all the inputs are preserved, and the number of inputs is
;;; kept with the output.
