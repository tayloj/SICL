\section{MIR interpreter}

\sysname{} provides a backend that can run in a \commonlisp{} system,
either intrinsically or extrinsically.  This backend is mainly used
in order to test that generated MIR code yields the expected result. 

The MIR interpreter works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The MIR code is translated to a \commonlisp{} program.  This
  program contains a lambda expression for each nested function.  The
  outermost lambda expression has no parameters.
\item The lambda expression is converted to a function using
  \texttt{compile}. 
\item The resulting function is executed by passing it to
  \texttt{funcall}. 
\end{itemize}

Each nested function has the following shape:

\begin{itemize}
\item The outermost form is a lambda expression with a lambda list of
  a particular form.  See below for details about the lambda list.
\item The body of the lambda expression is a \texttt{let} special
  form.  The variables of the \texttt{let} form are all the lexical
  variables used by the function, but not used by an enclosing
  function.  The \texttt{let} variables are all initialized to
  \texttt{nil}. 
\item The body of the \texttt{let} is a \texttt{block} special form.
  The name of the block is \texttt{nil}.  This block is used in the
  translation of the \texttt{return} instruction.  
\item The body of the block is a \texttt{tagbody} special form.  Each
  instruction generates a statement of the tagbody.  A statement may
  be preceded by a \texttt{tag} if there is a \texttt{go} to that
  statement. 
\end{itemize}

The lambda list of the function has no initialization forms.  Here are
the details of what it contains. 

\begin{itemize}
\item It has zero or more required parameters.  Each required
  parameter is a symbol naming a variable.  
\item It may have \texttt{\&optional} parameters.  Each such parameter
  is a list of two symbols.  The first symbol names the main parameter.
  The second symbol names a \emph{supplied-p} parameter.  The latter
  is included even when the original lambda list did not contain it.
  The body of the function tests the value of the \emph{supplied-p}
  parameter in order to determine whether to execute some
  initialization code that assigns a default value to the main
  parameter. 
\item It may have a \texttt{\&rest} parameter.  This parameter is just
  a symbol.
\item It may have \texttt{\&key} parameters.  Each such parameter is a
  list of three symbols.  The first symbol names the key to be
  searched for in the argument list to find the argument.  The second
  symbol names the main parameter.  The third symbol names a
  \emph{supplied-p} parameter.  As with \texttt{\&optional}
  parameters, the latter is included even when the original lambda
  list did not contain it.  Again, the body of the function tests the
  value of the \emph{supplied-p} parameter in order to determine
  whether to execute some initialization code that assigns a default
  value to the main parameter.
\item It may contain the lambda-list keyword
  \texttt{\&allow-other-keys}. 
\end{itemize}
