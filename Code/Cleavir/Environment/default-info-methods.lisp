;;;; This file contains methods on the generic functions defined in
;;;; the file query.lisp that are specialized to the classed defined
;;;; in the file default-augmentation-classes.lisp.  
;;;;
;;;; The implementation here is a bit twisted in that we pretty much
;;;; call a generic function for each elementary step.  The reason for
;;;; this way of doing it is so as to allow for an implementation to
;;;; specialize or override every such elementary step by defining
;;;; methods on those generic functions.
;;;;
;;;; In addition, even though the augmentation environments are chains
;;;; of small class instances resembling a list, we do not use
;;;; iteration in order to traverse them.  Instead we use recursion
;;;; where the default action is to make a recursive call, passing the
;;;; next instance in the chain.

;;; VARIABLE-INFO
;;;
;;; Finding info about a variable is a bit tricky, because there can
;;; be local entries modifying the properties of the variable, in
;;; particular the type of the variable. 
;;;
;;; We proceed by first finding the DEFINING INFO for the variable.
;;; This info might come from the global environment, or it can come
;;; from an ENTRY that defines the variable.
;;;
;;; Once we have found the defining info, we traverse the environment
;;; again in order to find modifying entries.  We do this traversal
;;; for each type of modifying entry possible.  The traversal stops
;;; either when we found the first relevant modifying entry, or we
;;; reach the place where the variable was defined, in which case no
;;; relevant modifying entry was found.

(defgeneric defining-variable-info (environment symbol))

;;; For entries with the right type to introduce a variable, we check
;;; whether the name in the entry is EQ to the symbol that we are
;;; passed as an argument.  If that is the case, we create and return
;;; a very basic corresponding INFO instance.  If the name in the
;;; entry is not EQ to the symbol we are passed as an argument, we
;;; invoke DEFINING-VARIABLE-INFO recursively with the remaining
;;; environment.
;;;
;;; The relevant entries for variable info are LEXICAL-VARIABLE,
;;; SPECIAL-VARIABLE, and SYMBOL-MACRO.  Since constant variables can
;;; only be global, there is no entry type for constant variables.
