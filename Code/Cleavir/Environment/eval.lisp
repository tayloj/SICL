;;; Generic function EVAL.
;;;
;;; We define EVAL as a generic function with three arguments: a form
;;; and two environments.  The first environment is the environment in
;;; which the form is to be evaluated.  The second environment is used
;;; for generic dispatch only.
;;;
;;; When some Cleavir tools such as the minimal compiler or the AST
;;; generator are used in a context where a top-level form is
;;; processed by the file compiler, it handles EVAL-WHEN with a
;;; situation of :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL by calling the EVAL generic
;;; function.
;;;
;;; The reason for calling the Cleavir-specific generic function
;;; rather than just calling CL:EVAL is that CL:EVAL might not be the
;;; right thing to do.  The problematic case is when the global
;;; environment (the so-called evaluation environment) is side
;;; effected at compile time, for instance as a result of evaluating a
;;; DEFUN form at compile time.
;;;
;;;   * When the Cleavir tools in question are used as extrinsic tools
;;;     (i.e., the host system is different from the target system),
;;;     then CL:EVAL will side effect the host environment, whereas it
;;;     is more likely that the target environment should be side
;;;     effected.  For instance, when a target system is bootstrapped
;;;     on a host system, the Cleavir tools might be used to fill up
;;;     the target environment with definitions of standard macros and
;;;     special operators.
;;;
;;;   * A solution that always works would be to handle compile-time
;;;     evaluation by converting the form to an AST and then
;;;     interpreting that AST.  However, then we have the inverse
;;;     problem, namely when the tools are used as intrinsic (native)
;;;     tools, then we might then store interpreted functions in the
;;;     global environment.  In this case, it is more likely that we
;;;     want to call the native EVAL function in order to obtain a
;;;     compiled
;;;
;;; Another problem with compile-time evaluation is that the standard
;;; treats the body of a LOCALLY, MACROLET, or a SYMBOL-MACROLET as a
;;; top-level form when the FORM itself is a top-level form.  The
;;; HyperSpec has a remark saying "Note that this implies that the
;;; lexical environment in which top level forms are processed is not
;;; necessarily the null lexical environment".  The problem here
;;; arises when the tools are used as intrinsic tools.  We can't just
;;; call CL:EVAL, because CL:EVAL always evaluates the form in the
;;; null lexical environment.
;;;
;;; Finally, the generic EVAL provides a solution that Cleavir uses
;;; for processing MACROLET forms.  The problem here is that the local
;;; macro definitions should be processed differently in the extrinsic
;;; and the intrinsic case.  In the extrinsic case, the expander
;;; functions should be generated as host functions so that expansion
;;; can take place at compile time.  Cleavir does this by calling the
;;; generic EVAL to process the lambda expressions resulting macro
;;; definitions.
;;;
;;; When the Cleavir tools are used as extrinsic tools, a reasonable
;;; method on EVAL would be to convert the form to an AST and then
;;; interpreting that AST in the global environment.  It is
;;; reasonable, because the AST presumably already contains all the
;;; results of the influence of the environment on the compilation
;;; process.  Furthermore, any side effect on the global environment
;;; will then happen in the target environment.  Function definitions
;;; that are entered into the target environment are interpreted, of
;;; course, but that is the only option for the extrinsic case anyway. 
;;;
;;; For the intrinsic case, the right solution is to convert the form
;;; to an AST and then to native code, and finally executing that
;;; native code.  This solution ensures that function definitions
;;; create native code.
;;;
;;; A quick-and-dirty (but incorrect) solution for the intrinsic case
;;; might be to minimally compile (in the sense of "minimal
;;; compilation") the form and then calling CL:EVAL on the result.  It
;;; is incorrect because any declarations present in the environment
;;; are lost when CL:EVAL is called.

;;; Generic function MACRO-FUNCTION.
;;;
;;; We define MACRO-FUNCTION as a generic function with two arguments:
;;; a symbol and an environment.  
;;;
;;; An implementation can use this function in the following way.
;;; Rather than defining implementation-specific methods on
;;; environment augmentation functions that create instances of
;;; corresponding implementation-specific environment augmentation
;;; classes, the implementation might choose to handle both the
;;; implementation-specific augmentation classes and the default
;;; augmentation classes provided by Cleavir.  In order to make this
;;; technique work, the implementation needs to do two things:
;;;
;;;   * Modify the existing implementation of CL:MACRO-FUNCTION so
;;;     that it calls the generic MACRO-FUNCTION here.  If the
;;;     optional argument to CL:MACRO-FUNCTION was supplied, it is
;;;     passed directly as the second argument to the generic
;;;     MACRO-FUNCTION.  If not, an argument representing the global
;;;     environment is passed instead. 
;;;
;;;   * Supply one or more methods on the generic MACRO-FUNCTION,
;;;     specialized to the implementation-specific global environment
;;;     classes (for implementations with first-class global
;;;     environments), or to an artificial class used as a proxy for
;;;     the global environment (for implementations that do not have
;;;     first-class global environments).  These methods should return
;;;     NIL when no macro function is found.
;;;
;;;   * Also, if CL:MACRO-FUNCTION will still be called with
;;;     implementation-specific lexical environments, supply one or
;;;     more methods on the generic MACRO-FUNCTION specialized to the
;;;     implementations-specific lexical environment classes.

;;; Generic function COMPILER-MACRO-FUNCTION
;;;
;;; The standard Common Lisp function MACRO-FUNCTION takes an optional
;;; ENVIRONMENT argument.  When that argument is a local environment
;;; in which there is a local function or macro definition with the
;;; same name, then that local definition shadows any existing global
;;; macro function.  For that reason, we must first search the local
;;; environment and return NIL if we see a local function or macro
;;; definition.  We accomplish this by defining a generic function,
;;; also called COMPILER-MACRO-FUNCTION.  We supply methods on that
;;; generic function that return NIL when called with a local function
;;; or macro definition with the right name.
;;;
;;; Implementations should define a method on this generic function
;;; that accomplishes the task for the specific global environment.
