(in-package #:cleavir-liveness)

;;;; Liveness analysis
;;;;
;;;; Each instruction I in a flow chart representing some program
;;;; defines a PROGRAM POINT, which is located IMMEDIATELY BEFORE I.
;;;; A variable V is LIVE at some program point P if and only if there
;;;; exists an execution path from P to the end of the flow chart on
;;;; which V is used before it is defined.
;;;;
;;;; Computing liveness is a dataflow problem that is best computed
;;;; from the end of the program to the beginning of the program.  Let
;;;; I be some instruction with successors S1, S2, ... Sn.  And also
;;;; let B(Si) be the set of live variables at the program point
;;;; defined by Si, for 1 <= i <= n.  To compute the set B(I) of live
;;;; variables of the program point defined by I, first compute A(I)
;;;; as the union of every B(Si).  Then intersect A(I) with the
;;;; variables written by I, and finally compute the union of the
;;;; resulting set with the variables used by I.
;;;;
;;;; Initially the sets A(I) and B(I) for each node are empty.  The
;;;; computation is iterated until a fixpoint is reached.
;;;;
;;;; The literature suggests using bitvectors for this computation,
;;;; where a particular item has a unique index in the bitvector.
;;;; However, to avoid storing the unique indices in the items, we
;;;; would have to maintain a hash table and a vector for the mapping
;;;; from items to indices and from indices to items respectively.
;;;; Instead we attempt to maintain the sets as Lisp lists.  If
;;;; performance becomes a problem, we might revisit this decision.
;;;;
;;;; Computing liveness can be done either on a flow chart or a flow
;;;; graph.

;;; The return value is an instance of the class LIVENESS.  This
