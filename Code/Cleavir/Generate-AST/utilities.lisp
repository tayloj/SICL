;;; Convenience functions for augmenting the environment with a set of

;;;
;;; Recall that a canonicalized declaration specifier is one of

;;;
;;;   * (declaration name)
;;;   * (dynamic-extent var)
;;;   * (dynamic-extent (function fn))
;;;   * (ftype type function-name)
;;;   * (ignore var)
;;;   * (ignore (function fn))
;;;   * (ignorable var)
;;;   * (ignorable (function fn))
;;;   * (inline function-name)
;;;   * (notinline function-name)
;;;   * (optimize (quality value))
;;;   * (special var)
;;;   * (type typespec var)

;;; Augment the environment with a single canonicalized declartion
;;; specifier.
