;;;; Recall that an ENTER-INSTRUCTION is the successor of no other
;;;; instruction.
;;;;
;;;; The ENTER-INSTRUCTIONs of a program constitute a directed tree.
;;;; An ENTER-INSTRUCTION I closer to the root of the tree than some
;;;; other ENTER-INSTRUCTION J is said to be located FURTHER OUT than
;;;; J.
;;;;
;;;; We introduce the concept of OWNERSHIP.  This concept is defined
;;;; for lexical variables and for instructions.  The OWNER of an
;;;; instruction or a lexical variable is an ENTER-INSTRUCTION.
;;;;
;;;; Ownership for instructions is defined as follows:
;;;;
;;;;   * The owner of an ENTER-INSTRUCTION is itself.
;;;;
;;;;   * For all instruction types, EXCEPT the UNWIND-INSTRUCTION, the
;;;;     owner of the successors of an instruction I is the same as
;;;;     the owner of I.
;;;;
;;;;   * The owner of the successor of an UNWIND-INSTRUCTION I is the
;;;;     value returned by calling (INVOCATION I).
;;;;
;;;; The owner of a datum D is the outermost ENTER-INSTRUCTION of all
;;;; the owners of all the instructions using D.
;;;;
;;;; Each ENTER-INSTRUCTION A defines a PROCEDURE which is a the set
;;;; of all the instructions owned by A.  We extend the definition of
;;;; ownership so that a procedure P is the owner of some instruction
;;;; or datum X if an only if the unique ENTER-INSTRUCTION of P is the
;;;; owner of X.
;;;;
;;;; A procedure P is said to DEPEND on a different procedure Q if and
;;;; only if P or any of its descendants owns an instruction I (which
;;;; must then be an UNWIND-INSTRUCTION) with a successor owned by Q,
;;;; or if some instruction I owned by P or any of its descendants
;;;; refers to a datum owned by Q.
;;;;
;;;; The DROP of a procedure P is defined recursively as follows:
;;;;
;;;;   * If P depends on no other procedure then its drop is 0.
;;;;
;;;;   * Otherwise, the drop of P is d+1, where d is the
;;;;     maximum drop of any of the procedures it depends on.
;;;;
;;;; The drop is important for the following reason.  The runtime
;;;; environment could be organized as a list of LEVELS, where each
;;;; level is a vector.  A procedure P then has a runtime environment
;;;; with N = d+1 levels in it where d is the drop of P.  When some
;;;; procedure P with drop d executes an ENCLOSE-INSTRUCTION with some
;;;; procedure Q with drop e as an argument, then the top d-e+1 levels
;;;; of the static runtime environment of P should be discarded in
;;;; order to obtain the enclosed runtime environment.  Furthermore if
;;;; some procedure P with drop d accesses a variable owned by a
;;;; procedure Q with drop e, then level d-e of the static runtime
;;;; should be consulted.
