This test is meant to measure the time to check a 2-bit tag using the
most direct method by copying the datum, masking the tag and testing
its value

Results:

  Intel Core i5-2500K 3,30 GHz

    CPU time: 5.5 seconds.

    If we subtract the time it takes to execute the empty loop (2.7s),
    we get 2.8s, which gives 0.28 ns for the test.  This corresponds
    to a single cycle.
